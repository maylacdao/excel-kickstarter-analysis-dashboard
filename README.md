# Kickstarter Campaigns: Data analysis and Dashboard

Data: [Kickstarter Campaigns Data](data/Data_Kickstarter_Projects.csv)

## Objective

Create an interactive dashboard showcasing results of an analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.

### Data Cleaning

1. Convert file format from CSV to XLSX to (1) preserve integrity of original data source and (2) ensure that all changes are saved.
2. Format for easier viewing (i.e. freezing header row, center-aligning, adjust column widths, etc.).
3. Delete unnecessary data columns and rename columns, as needed.
4. Format data types accordingly.
5. Clean and trim individual string data types (=CLEAN(TRIM(PROPER(A2))) or =CLEAN(TRIM(UPPER(E2))) ). Populate the rest of the rows using the fill handle.
6. Copy the cleaned values over to the appropriate columns (Ctrl+Shift+Down Arrow, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Home, Click on appropriate column, Right click, "Paste Special", "Values").
7. Check for null values. Make judgment call, whether to keep or delete data with null values.
